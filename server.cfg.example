# Copy these lines to your server.cfg and customize with your database details
#
# SECURITY TIP: Never share your server.cfg file publicly with passwords in it!
# =============================================================================

# --- DATABASE CONNECTION (Choose ONE method) ---

# METHOD 1: Connection String (RECOMMENDED - easiest setup)
# This is the simplest way to configure your database connection.
# Format: mysql://username:password@host:port/database_name
# 
# Replace these values with your actual database credentials:
#   - username: Your database user (e.g., fivem_user)
#   - password: Your database password (keep this secure!)
#   - host: Database server address (use 'localhost' if on same machine)
#   - port: Database port (default is 3306 for MySQL/MariaDB)
#   - database_name: Name of your database (e.g., fivem_database)
#
# Example:
set mysql_connection_string "mysql://fivem_user:your_secure_password@localhost:3306/fivem_database"


# METHOD 2: Individual Settings (alternative)
# If you prefer to set each option separately, comment out the connection 
# string above and uncomment these lines below:
#
# set mysql_host "localhost"              # Database server address
# set mysql_port "3306"                   # Database port (default: 3306)
# set mysql_user "fivem_user"             # Database username
# set mysql_password "your_secure_password"  # Database password (keep secure!)
# set mysql_database "fivem_database"     # Database name
#
# IMPORTANT: Use EITHER the connection string OR individual settings, not both!
# If both are provided, the connection string takes priority.


# --- OPTIONAL SETTINGS ---

# Maximum Concurrent Database Connections (default: 10)
# This controls how many simultaneous database queries can run at once.
# 
# Recommendations by server size:
#   - Small server (< 20 players): 5-10 connections
#   - Medium server (20-50 players): 10-20 connections
#   - Large server (50-100 players): 20-40 connections
#   - Very large server (100+ players): 40-60 connections
#
# Note: More connections use more RAM. Start low and increase if needed.
# Monitor using: exports['ingenium.sql']:getStats() from another resource
#
set mysql_connection_limit "10"


# Character Encoding (default: utf8mb4)
# utf8mb4 supports all Unicode characters including emoji and international text.
# 
# Options:
#   - utf8mb4: RECOMMENDED - Full Unicode support (emoji, special characters)
#   - utf8: Legacy Unicode support (no emoji)
#   - latin1: Basic ASCII only (not recommended)
#
# Unless you have a specific reason, leave this as utf8mb4
#
set mysql_charset "utf8mb4"


# --- ADVANCED OPTIONS (Usually not needed) ---

# Connection Timeout (milliseconds)
# How long to wait when establishing a new database connection
# Default: 10000 (10 seconds)
#
# set mysql_connect_timeout "10000"

# Query Timeout (milliseconds)  
# Maximum time to wait for a query to complete
# Default: 60000 (60 seconds)
#
# set mysql_query_timeout "60000"


# --- START THE RESOURCE ---
# This line should be added after your other resource 'ensure' lines
# Make sure ingenium.sql starts before any resources that need database access
#
ensure ingenium.sql

# TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS
# =============================================================================
#
# ❌ "Cannot connect to database"
#    - Check that MySQL/MariaDB is running
#    - Verify your username, password, and database name are correct
#    - Make sure the database exists (create it if needed)
#    - Check that your database user has proper permissions
#
# ❌ "Access denied for user"
#    - Your username or password is incorrect
#    - Or the database user doesn't have permissions on this database
#    - Try connecting manually: mysql -u username -p database_name
#
# ❌ "Unknown database"
#    - The database doesn't exist
#    - Create it: CREATE DATABASE fivem_database;
#
# ❌ Resource fails to start
#    - Check the resource folder is named exactly "ingenium.sql"
#    - Make sure you ran "npm install" in the resource folder
#    - Check FiveM server console for specific error messages
