# Instructions for Creating GitHub Release v1.0.2

This document provides step-by-step instructions for creating the GitHub release for version 1.0.2.

## Prerequisites

- The code changes for v1.0.2 have been committed and pushed to the repository
- You have maintainer/admin access to the repository
- The package.json version has been updated to 1.0.2

## Steps to Create the Release

### Option 1: Using GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)

1. Navigate to https://github.com/Ingenium-Games/ingenium.sql/releases
2. Click "Draft a new release" button
3. Fill in the release details:
   - **Tag version**: `v1.0.2`
   - **Target**: Select the branch with the v1.0.2 changes (e.g., `copilot/create-release-version-1-0-2` or `main` if merged)
   - **Release title**: `Version 1.0.2 - First Public Stable Release`
   - **Description**: Copy the contents from `RELEASE_NOTES_v1.0.2.md`
4. Check "Set as the latest release"
5. Click "Publish release"

### Option 2: Using GitHub CLI (gh)

```bash
# Navigate to the repository
cd /path/to/ingenium.sql

# Create the release with the tag
gh release create v1.0.2 \
  --title "Version 1.0.2 - First Public Stable Release" \
  --notes-file RELEASE_NOTES_v1.0.2.md \
  --latest

# If you want to include the source code archive automatically, it will be done by GitHub
```

### Option 3: Using Git Tag + GitHub Release (Two-step)

```bash
# Step 1: Create and push the tag
cd /path/to/ingenium.sql
git tag -a v1.0.2 -m "Version 1.0.2 - First Public Stable Release"
git push origin v1.0.2

# Step 2: Go to GitHub and create a release from the tag
# Follow the web interface steps above, but select "v1.0.2" as an existing tag
```

## What Gets Included in the Release

GitHub will automatically create source code archives (zip and tar.gz) containing:
- All source files
- package.json (version 1.0.2)
- README.md with updated installation instructions
- Configuration examples
- Documentation files
- **Note**: node_modules are NOT included (they're in .gitignore)

Users will need to either:
1. Download the release and run `npm install` (Build from Source option)
2. Wait for a future release that includes a pre-packaged version with node_modules

## Post-Release Tasks

After creating the release:

1. Verify the release appears on https://github.com/Ingenium-Games/ingenium.sql/releases
2. Test downloading the release archive
3. Verify the installation instructions in README.md work correctly
4. Announce the release in appropriate channels
5. Update any related documentation or wiki pages

## Release Artifacts

The release will include:
- **Source code (zip)**: Auto-generated by GitHub
- **Source code (tar.gz)**: Auto-generated by GitHub

These archives can be extracted to a FiveM resources folder, and users can run `npm install` to set up the dependencies.

## Notes

- The git tag `v1.0.2` has been created locally but not pushed due to authentication limitations
- When creating the release on GitHub, the tag will be created automatically if it doesn't exist
- Users downloading the release will need to run `npm install` as node_modules is not committed to the repository
- This is intentional and follows best practices for Node.js projects
